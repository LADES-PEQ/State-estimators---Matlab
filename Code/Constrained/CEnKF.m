% Note1: The algorithm is equivalent to the ensemble Kalman filter,
% proposed by Evensen (1994), if there are no active constraints in
% the projection function
% 
% Note2: The variables with the prefix "Ensemble" have calculations for each 
% ensemble member propagated based on the column position.
%
% Note3: The variable Ensemble_priori is returned to speed up computational
% time of a forward-backward filtering.
