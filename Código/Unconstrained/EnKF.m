%
% Inputs:
% F - State transition function
% H - Measurement function
% Ensemble_prior - State estimations at time k-1 for each ensemble member
% u - Set of time-invariant variables between sampling times k-1 and k

% Q - Covariance matrix of the process noises
% R - Covariance matrix of the observation noises
% Jacob_y - Jacobian of the state transition function
% 
% Outputs:
% Pxx_poster - State error covariance matrix at time k
% x_poster - State estimation at time k
% Ensemble_poster - State estimations at time k for each ensemble member

% Note2: The variables with the prefix "Ensemble" have calculations for each

%
% Note3: The ensemble Kalman filter does not require prior knowledge about 
% measurement noises; however, R is usually defined for the observer. Current
% implementation estimates R in each sampling time for an empty input.
